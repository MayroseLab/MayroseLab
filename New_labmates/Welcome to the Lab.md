# Welcome to the Mayrose lab!

**If you don't have TAU cluster user**
please request one from the HPC and lifeguard personnel. Ask them to create a new user for you and ensure that your home directory is set to /groups/itay_mayrose within the lab directory. Additionally, make sure that both your .bashrc and .xauthority files are redirected to your new user's root.

**For all users** seek permission to access powerlogin, power9login, and the Itay Mayrose queues.
